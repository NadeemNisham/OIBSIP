## Task List
### Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification
#### Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ according to their measurements. I have assumed that the measurements of the iris flowers are according to their species, and here my task was to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
### Task 2 - Unemployment Analysis using Python
#### Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
### Task 3 - Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
#### The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives, and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.
### Task 4 - Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning
#### Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
### Task 5 - Sales Prediction using Python
#### Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
